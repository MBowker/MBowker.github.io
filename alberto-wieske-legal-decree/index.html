        <p>Notice to anyone considering a legal contract with Alberto Wieske, who lived in Dublin, Ireland in 2018. There is an outstanding legal decree against him for the sum of â‚¬809.50. Though Mr Wieske was notified of this decree, he refused to pay the amount owed. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, I was unable to pursue further legal action to enforce the claim before leaving Ireland. Those considering any legal contract with Mr Wieske should consider his history very carefully before proceeding. For further information, feel free to contact me at markalanbowker@gmail.com</p>
