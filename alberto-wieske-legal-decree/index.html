      <h1>Legal Decree Against Alberto Wieske</h1>
      <p>
        Notice to anyone considering a legal contract with <strong>Alberto Wieske</strong>, who lived in <strong>Dublin</strong>, Ireland in 2018 and was associated with <strong>Microsoft</strong>. There is an outstanding <strong>legal decree</strong> against him for the sum of â‚¬809.50, issued by the DMD District Court in Ireland. Though Mr Wieske was notified of this decree, he refused to pay the amount owed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the coronavirus pandemic, I was unable to pursue further legal action to enforce the claim before leaving Ireland. Anyone considering a legal agreement with Mr Wieske should carefully consider this history before proceeding. For further information, please contact me at <a href="mailto:markalanbowker@gmail.com">markalanbowker@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>
